# kitsune
kitsune is an exploration of the research done by [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in regards to [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphago/). The main source of inspiration is based off the paper [Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search) Authored by David Silver, Aja Huang, Christopher Maddison and others. kitsune uses deep neural networks, monte carlo tree search and other algorithms still under progress, to create a model that surpases humans ability to play go. The program is primarily written in C++ for efficiency.
